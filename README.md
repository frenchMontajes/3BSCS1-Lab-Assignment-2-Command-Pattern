# Smart Home Automation System

## Overview

This project implements a flexible and scalable smart home automation system to control various devices such as lights, thermostats, and music players using a central hub or app. Each device can respond to specific commands like "Turn On," "Turn Off," "Increase Temperature," and "Decrease Volume," and the system supports adding new devices seamlessly.

## Design a system that allows you to control multiple smart home devices with ease. Your goal is to create a solution where:
- You can control a variety of devices from a central hub or app, sending commands like "Turn On," "Turn Off," "Increase Temperature," "Decrease Volume," etc.
- Each device has unique actions associated with these commands. For example, turning on the lights might involve changing their brightness level, while turning on the music player may involve playing a specific playlist.
- New devices can be seamlessly integrated into the system without modifying existing code. You want to ensure that adding a new device doesn't require changes to the central control logic.
- Devices can be controlled without the central hub or app needing to understand the internal workings of each device. It should send high-level commands without needing low-level details.

Your challenge is to apply a design pattern that provides a flexible and scalable way to control a variety of smart home devices, ensuring that new devices can be added without disrupting the existing system's functionality.
